## **1. What is Flutter?**

**Formal:**
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for **mobile (iOS, Android), web, and desktop** from a single codebase using the Dart programming language.

**Layman:**
Flutter is like a magical toolkit that lets you make apps for phones, computers, and the web using **one set of code**, instead of writing separate apps for iPhone and Android.

## **2. Flutter Architecture**

Flutter has 3 main layers:

1. **Flutter Engine** – Core responsible for rendering graphics, text, and handling input.
2. **Foundation Library** – Provides basic classes and functions like animations, gestures, collections.
3. **Widgets** – Everything you see on the screen is a widget (buttons, text, images, layouts).

**Layman:**
Think of it like a cake:

* The engine is the base (baking the cake),
* The foundation is the ingredients (flour, sugar…),
* Widgets are the decoration (icing, sprinkles…).

---

## **3. Dart Language**

* Flutter apps are written in **Dart**.
* Dart is **object-oriented** and easy to learn if you know Java, JavaScript, or C#.
* **Key Dart concepts for Flutter:**

  * Variables (`int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`)
  * Functions
  * Classes & objects
  * Null safety (`?` and `!`)
  * Lists and Maps

---

## **4. Flutter Widgets**

Everything in Flutter is a **widget**. There are two types:

1. **StatelessWidget** – Doesn’t change its state. Static content.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Center(
         child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. **StatefulWidget** – Can change its state dynamically.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _CounterState createState() => _CounterState();
   }

   class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
     int count = 0;

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Column(
         mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
         children: [
           Text('Count: $count'),
           ElevatedButton(
             onPressed: () {
               setState(() {
                 count++;
               });
             },
             child: Text('Increment'),
           ),
         ],
       );
     }
   }
   ```

**Layman:**

* StatelessWidget = “A picture frame” → never changes.
* StatefulWidget = “Whiteboard” → you can draw and erase stuff on it.

---

## **5. Layouts**

Widgets can be **combined** to create layouts:

* **Row** → horizontal
* **Column** → vertical
* **Stack** → overlapping widgets
* **Container** → box with color, padding, margin

Example:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Text('Hello'),
    Row(
      children: [
        Icon(Icons.star),
        Text('Star'),
      ],
    ),
  ],
)
```

## **6. Common Widgets**

| Widget         | Purpose                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Text           | Display text                                     |
| Image          | Display images                                   |
| Icon           | Show icons                                       |
| Scaffold       | Basic page layout (AppBar, Body, FloatingButton) |
| AppBar         | Top bar of the app                               |
| ElevatedButton | Button                                           |
| TextField      | Input field                                      |
| ListView       | Scrollable list                                  |

## **7. Flutter Project Structure**

```
my_app/
  android/     -> Native Android code
  ios/         -> Native iOS code
  lib/         -> Dart code (main.dart is entry point)
  pubspec.yaml -> Project config & dependencies
```

* **`main.dart`** is where the app starts.
* **`pubspec.yaml`** is where you add dependencies (like external packages for charts, maps, etc.).

---

## **8. Running Flutter App**

1. Install Flutter SDK.
2. Create a new project:

   ```bash
   flutter create my_app
   cd my_app
   flutter run
   ```
3. You can run on:

   * Emulator
   * Physical device
   * Web (optional)

---

## **9. Hot Reload & Hot Restart**

* **Hot Reload** → Quickly see UI changes without restarting the app.
* **Hot Restart** → Restarts the app and rebuilds everything from scratch.

**Layman:**
Hot reload = like painting over your canvas.
Hot restart = cleaning the canvas and starting fresh.

---

## **10. State Management (Basics)**

* For small apps, use `setState()` inside StatefulWidget.
* For larger apps, explore **Provider**, **Riverpod**, **Recoil**, **BLoC**, or **GetX**.

---

## ✅ **Takeaways**

1. Flutter uses **Dart** language.
2. Everything is a **widget**.
3. **StatelessWidget** = static, **StatefulWidget** = dynamic.
4. **Layouts** = Rows, Columns, Stack, Containers.
5. **Hot Reload** speeds up development.
6. Start with **Scaffold → AppBar → Body → Widgets inside**.
7. For bigger apps, **state management** is crucial.
